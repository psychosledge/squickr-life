## 🎉 Session 2 Complete - Strategic Features Delivered! ✅

**Completed Today (January 31, 2026):**

### ✅ Collapse Completed Tasks Feature (4-5 hours)
- Per-collection setting to collapse completed tasks
- Completed tasks shown in expandable section at bottom
- Settings option added to collection menu (⋮)
- Default: OFF (preserves current behavior)
- Backend: `CollectionSettingsUpdated` event + `UpdateCollectionSettingsHandler`
- Frontend: `CollectionSettingsModal` + collapsible UI in `CollectionDetailView`
- 42 new tests (13 backend + 29 frontend)
- **Casey Review:** 9.5/10 - "Exceptional implementation"
- **Status:** Committed (commit 52e10f7)

### ✅ Create Collection During Migration (3-4 hours)
- Added "+ Create New Collection" option in migration modal
- Streamlined workflow (no need to cancel and restart)
- Nested modal flow with auto-selection
- Renamed: `MoveEntryToCollectionModal` → `MigrateEntryModal` (more BuJo-authentic)
- Updated terminology throughout UI
- 29 new tests for nested modal flow
- **Casey Review:** 8.5/10 - "Solid, well-tested implementation"
- **Status:** Committed (commit 52e10f7)

**Total Time:** ~7-8 hours (estimate was 6-9 hours) ✅  
**Test Count:** 736 tests passing (348 backend + 388 frontend)  
**Code Quality:** Both features approved by Casey, ready for production

**Architecture Decision Made:**
- **Deferred collection types** - Opted for per-collection view option instead of fundamental collection types
- Rationale: Solves immediate problem (clutter), more flexible, doesn't lock into architecture before understanding real usage patterns
- Future: Can introduce types later when calendar integration or habit trackers are needed

### ✅ #3: Active Task Count on Collection Index (3 hours)
- Shows "3 active tasks" instead of "5 entries"
- Smart display: "No active tasks" / "1 active task" / "N active tasks"

**Total Time:** ~5 hours  
**Test Count:** 667 tests passing

## 📋 Enhancement Backlog (Future Sessions)

---

### Future Considerations

#### Collection Types (Deferred)
**Decision:** Deferred in favor of per-collection view options  
**Rationale:** 
- Current solution (collapse completed toggle) solves immediate problem
- More flexible - users control each collection individually
- Don't need to commit to type architecture before understanding real usage patterns
- Can revisit when adding calendar integration or habit trackers

**Future scenarios where types might be needed:**
- Calendar views for daily logs
- Habit tracker charts
- Entry type restrictions (tasks-only collections)
- Collection-specific default icons/colors

---

### Development Workflow
1. Write tests first (TDD approach)
2. Implement feature incrementally
3. Run `pnpm test` to verify all tests pass
4. Run `pnpm build` to verify TypeScript compiles
5. Commit with clear message (e.g., "feat: add periodic background sync")
6. Push to master (auto-deploys to production)

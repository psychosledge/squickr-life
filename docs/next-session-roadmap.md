# Next Session Roadmap
**Last Updated:** January 31, 2026

## 🎉 Session 2 Complete - Strategic Features Delivered! ✅

**Completed Today (January 31, 2026):**

### ✅ Collapse Completed Tasks Feature (4-5 hours)
- Per-collection setting to collapse completed tasks
- Completed tasks shown in expandable section at bottom
- Settings option added to collection menu (⋮)
- Default: OFF (preserves current behavior)
- Backend: `CollectionSettingsUpdated` event + `UpdateCollectionSettingsHandler`
- Frontend: `CollectionSettingsModal` + collapsible UI in `CollectionDetailView`
- 42 new tests (13 backend + 29 frontend)
- **Casey Review:** 9.5/10 - "Exceptional implementation"
- **Status:** Committed (commit 52e10f7)

### ✅ Create Collection During Migration (3-4 hours)
- Added "+ Create New Collection" option in migration modal
- Streamlined workflow (no need to cancel and restart)
- Nested modal flow with auto-selection
- Renamed: `MoveEntryToCollectionModal` → `MigrateEntryModal` (more BuJo-authentic)
- Updated terminology throughout UI
- 29 new tests for nested modal flow
- **Casey Review:** 8.5/10 - "Solid, well-tested implementation"
- **Status:** Committed (commit 52e10f7)

**Total Time:** ~7-8 hours (estimate was 6-9 hours) ✅  
**Test Count:** 736 tests passing (348 backend + 388 frontend)  
**Code Quality:** Both features approved by Casey, ready for production

**Architecture Decision Made:**
- **Deferred collection types** - Opted for per-collection view option instead of fundamental collection types
- Rationale: Solves immediate problem (clutter), more flexible, doesn't lock into architecture before understanding real usage patterns
- Future: Can introduce types later when calendar integration or habit trackers are needed

See detailed implementation notes in this session's conversation history.

## 📋 Remaining Enhancement Backlog

### 🟢 POLISH: Session 3 (Future Enhancements)

#### User Profile Menu 🎨 UX IMPROVEMENT
**Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Priority:** 🟡 Medium - Improves header UX, especially on mobile  
**Files:** `CollectionIndexView.tsx`, `AuthContext.tsx`

**Current Behavior:**
- Email address displayed as text in header (e.g., "user@example.com")
- Separate "Sign Out" button next to email
- Takes up significant space on mobile
- No visual indication of signed-in user (no profile picture)

**Desired Behavior:**
- Google profile picture displayed as clickable avatar
- Clicking avatar opens dropdown menu with:
  - User email (display name if available)
  - "Sign Out" option
  - Future: Settings, Account info
- Compact design saves header space

**UI Mockup:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Squickr Life              [👤 ▼]   │  ← Profile avatar with dropdown indicator
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

When clicked:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Squickr Life              [👤 ▼]   │
│                         ┌──────────┐│
│                         │ John Doe ││  ← Display name
│                         │ user@... ││  ← Email (truncated)
│                         ├──────────┤│
│                         │ Sign Out ││
│                         └──────────┘│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation:**
1. **Get User Photo URL** from Firebase Auth user object (`user.photoURL`)
2. **Create ProfileMenu Component:**
   - Avatar image (circular, fallback to initials if no photo)
   - Dropdown menu (similar to collection menu pattern)
   - Display name from `user.displayName` or email
   - Sign out option
3. **Replace Header Layout:**
   - Remove text email + sign out button
   - Add ProfileMenu component
   - Responsive sizing (larger on desktop, compact on mobile)
4. **Accessibility:**
   - Proper ARIA labels
   - Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
   - Focus management

**Files to Modify:**
- `packages/client/src/views/CollectionIndexView.tsx` (replace sign-out UI)
- `packages/client/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` (expose photoURL and displayName)
- Create `packages/client/src/components/ProfileMenu.tsx` (new component)
- Add ~15-20 tests for ProfileMenu component

**Design Considerations:**
- Avatar size: 32px mobile, 40px desktop
- Fallback: Show user initials if no photo (e.g., "JD" for John Doe)
- Menu position: Right-aligned dropdown, z-index above other content
- Consistent with existing menu patterns (CollectionHeader menu)

**Why This Matters:**
- Cleaner header, especially on mobile
- Visual confirmation of signed-in account (helpful with multiple Google accounts)
- Better use of space
- Scalable for future profile/settings options

#### Collection Navigation (Page Flipping) 🎨 JOURNAL METAPHOR
**Effort:** 8-9 hours  
**Priority:** 🟢 Low - Nice to have, aligns with journal metaphor  
**Files:** Multiple - headers, keyboard handlers, gesture library

**Desired Behavior:**  
Navigate between collections like flipping pages in a physical journal.

**Features:**
- **Previous/Next Arrow Buttons** in collection headers
  - Show previous/next collection names on hover
  - Disable when at first/last collection
  
- **Swipe Gestures** on mobile
  - Swipe right → Previous collection
  - Swipe left → Next collection
  
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** on desktop
  - Left arrow → Previous collection
  - Right arrow → Next collection
  - Only active when not editing text

**Implementation:**
1. **Navigation Order** - Use collection index sort order
2. **Header Buttons** - Add to `CollectionViewHeader.tsx`
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Global event listener with input detection
4. **Swipe Gestures** - Add gesture library (e.g., `react-swipeable`)
5. **Circular Navigation** - Decide if first/last wraps around

**Dependencies:**
- May need gesture library for swipe detection
- Requires careful keyboard event handling (don't interfere with editing)

**Why This Matters:**  
Makes the app feel more like a physical bullet journal, improving the user experience.

### Future Considerations

#### Collection Types (Deferred)
**Decision:** Deferred in favor of per-collection view options  
**Rationale:** 
- Current solution (collapse completed toggle) solves immediate problem
- More flexible - users control each collection individually
- Don't need to commit to type architecture before understanding real usage patterns
- Can revisit when adding calendar integration or habit trackers

**Future scenarios where types might be needed:**
- Calendar views for daily logs
- Habit tracker charts
- Entry type restrictions (tasks-only collections)
- Collection-specific default icons/colors

# Event Models

This document contains all event models created by **Model-First Morgan** for Squickr Life.

## What is Event Modeling?

Event modeling is a visual technique for designing event-sourced systems. It focuses on:
- **User actions** - What the user does
- **Commands** - Intent to change state
- **Events** - Facts that happened
- **Projections** - Views derived from events

Each feature will be documented here with:
- User story
- Event flow timeline
- Event schemas
- State transitions
- UI implications

### Coming Soon: Create Task

Morgan will add the first event model when we reach that phase.

*Event models are living documents - they evolve as we learn more about user needs.*

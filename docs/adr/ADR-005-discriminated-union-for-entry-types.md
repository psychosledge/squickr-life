# ADR-005: Discriminated Union for Entry Types

**Date**: 2026-01-25  
**Status**: Accepted

## Context
UI needs to render three entry types with different:
- Bullet symbols: ☐ (task), - (note), ○ (event)
- Fields: Tasks have status, Notes have content, Events have dates
- Behaviors: Only tasks complete, only events have optional dates

## Decision
Use discriminated unions with type narrowing:

```typescript
type Entry = 
  | (Task & { type: 'task' })
  | (Note & { type: 'note' })
  | (Event & { type: 'event' })
```

TypeScript narrows types automatically:
```typescript
if (entry.type === 'task') {
  // TypeScript knows: entry.status and entry.title exist
}
```

## Rationale
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript narrows types based on discriminant
- **Single List**: Render all entry types in unified timeline
- **Compile-Time Checks**: Impossible to access wrong fields
- **Pattern Matching**: Clean switch/if statements

**Alternatives Rejected:**
- Separate lists: Loses unified timeline
- Type casting: Unsafe, defeats TypeScript
- Dynamic property access: No type checking

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Type-safe polymorphism, zero runtime overhead
- Clean, readable component code
- Perfect autocomplete in VSCode
- Safe refactoring (TypeScript catches errors)

**Negative:**
- Requires understanding discriminated unions
- Must handle all cases in switches (TypeScript enforces)

## SOLID Principles
- **Open/Closed**: Adding new entry types extends the union
- **Liskov Substitution**: All entries treated uniformly where appropriate
